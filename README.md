# 🏥 Hospital Performance Analytics using SQL

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing hospital performance data using SQL to generate meaningful insights related to patients, services, and staff utilization.  
The objective is to demonstrate **Data Analyst–level analytical thinking** by solving real-world business problems using structured SQL queries.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze service-level hospital performance
- Understand patient demographics and satisfaction trends
- Evaluate staff distribution and utilization
- Build analytical SQL queries suitable for dashboards and reports
- Apply intermediate to advanced SQL concepts used in Data Analyst roles

## 📂 Dataset Description
The project uses multiple relational tables representing hospital operations.  
*Note: This dataset is simulated for analytical learning purposes.*

### 🗃️ Tables Used
- **patients** – patient details, age, service, satisfaction, arrival & departure dates  
- **services_weekly** – weekly service metrics (admissions, refusals, satisfaction, events)  
- **staff** – staff details, roles, and service assignments  
- **staff_schedule** – staff attendance and availability by week

## 🔍 Key SQL Skills Demonstrated
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for modular query design  
- Window Functions  
  - `ROW_NUMBER()`  
  - `RANK()` / `DENSE_RANK()`  
  - `AVG() OVER()`  
  - Running totals & moving averages  
- Aggregations & Grouping  
- Joins (`INNER`, `LEFT`)  
- Subqueries & Derived Tables  
- `CASE` statements  
- Date & Time functions
